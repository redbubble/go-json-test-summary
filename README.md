Utility for neatly summarising Go JSON test output.

## Introduction

This allows the output from a `go test -json` command (the `-json` flag is
introduced in Go 1.10) to be piped into it for prettier formatting and more
easily identified test failures.

Example usage:

```
# Install this utility
$ go get -u github.com/redbubble/go-passe

# Run some tests
$ go test -v -json ./... | go-passe
```

### What it looks like

Without go-passe: `$ go test -v ./...`

With go-passe: `$ go test -v -json ./... | go-passe`

Test failures are summarised at the end for readability.

Without go-passe: `$ go test -v ./...`

## Developing

`go-passe` uses `dep` for dependency management.

```
# Install dep if necessary
$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep

# Ensure all dependencies are available/fetched
$ dep ensure
```
